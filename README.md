# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.
It is a basic website that will contain several recipe pages.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate basic HTML skills,
including creating pages, working with links, lists, images,
and organizing a simple project using Git and GitHub.
