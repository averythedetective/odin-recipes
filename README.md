# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.
It is a basic website that contains several recipe pages.

Through this project, I am demonstrating basic HTML skills,
including creating pages, working with links, lists, images,
and organizing a simple project using Git and GitHub.

## What I learned
The most important thing I learned is that it's very important to start with a foundational structure first (HTML boilerplate in this case along with a few additions to it), which gives us a mental clarity going forward and it helps with keeping things more standardized.

Secondly, I learned how commit messages are used in many different contexts when programming, it helped me practice forming my commit messages in such a way that it would be very easy for another person to see and understand what's going on under the hood. It especially helps with keeping the track of code and remediating the mistakes very early as they are found almost instantly.

And lastly, I learned that organizing the file structure of your repo is very important, as it keeps the whole project neat and clean - which makes it quite easy to work with (especially for other developers who collaborate with you).
